            <p> individual member colleges. Because all of the colleges were part of CC of C,
it was generally believed that all colleges operated with similar student
services procedures. As CCCOnline moved towards the end of the first
semester, there was a gradual realization that individual college student
services departments varied widely in their practices. Among other things, the
                colleges did not use common grading policies or common forms.<br>
            &nbsp;  &nbsp; For example: some colleges did not use an F as a part of their grading
scale; some colleges allowed the student to receive an S for satisfactory
work; and other colleges did not allow an S letter grade. The colleges were
reluctant to change their traditional grading policies. This meant that the
instructor had to read the policies of the home college of each student in
his/her class to determine the appropriate grading policy. The grading
policy, initially posted on CCCOnline, reflected each college’s individual
                grading policy and was 37 pages long!<br>
          &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Also, each college had its own grade change, withdrawal and incomplete forms, so instructors wishing to use one of these forms on behalf of
an individual student had to contact the student’s home college and
request and submit the proper forms. It wasn’t long before faculty began
                to complain loudly.</p>
            <div>
          <h3>Instructional Services Issues</h3>
       <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp;Faculty were dissatisfied with the myriad of forms that they had to use and
some were dissatisfied with the faculty pay plan. When CCCOnline was
created, a separate faculty pay plan was developed. Under this plan, the
colleges who employed the instructors teaching for CCCOnline would
prepare “overload contracts” for those instructors. The colleges would then
request reimbursement from CECC for these contracts. CECC would reimburse each college the same flat rate, hourly amount regardless of how much
the colleges paid their faculty for normal overload contracts. Most colleges
paid their CCCOnline instructors the total amount that would be reimbursed
by CECC; some colleges paid their CCCOnline instructors <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> than the
reimbursement from CECC and absorbed the additional costs internally; and
a small minority of colleges paid their CCCOnline instructors <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> than the
reimbursement amount from CECC. Faculty who were being paid less
demanded that they be paid on par with their contemporaries. The colleges
that were paying less stated that they would not compromise existing overload
pay plans and that it would be unfair to pay their CCCOnline faculty higher
overload rates than the traditional overload rates<br>
            
            &nbsp;  &nbsp;The second concern that surfaced quickly was how to develop new
                courses and degrees consortially. Within a couple months of placing the</p>

        <p>associate degree online, CECC began investigating the development of other
degrees that would allow students to upgrade their skills for new employment
or career advancement. From the beginning, small groups of faculty at
different colleges complained that they had no input into the original degree
and demanded a more inclusive process for degree development.</p>
            <h3>Business Services Issues</h3>
            <p> &emsp;Almost immediately upon opening the CCCOnline website to enrollments, the business services units of the colleges identified two areas of high
concern. Students complained that they could apply and enroll online but they
could not pay tuition online. All of the colleges accepted credit card payments
in person or over the telephone, but there was no protected, encrypted
software program that allowed students to pay online. System business
services staff, the CC of C's computer services staff, and the vendor’s
technical staff held many meetings to iron out the timeline and the roles each
unit would play in securing an online payment service for students.<br> 
            &emsp; Enrollment reconciliation, however, caused the most angst for the
business officers. After the census date, the vendor would submit an invoice
based upon the number of credit hours the CCCOnline students were enrolled.
Most of the time, the enrollment figures reported by the vendor were higher
than the enrollment figures reported by the individual colleges. Generally, this
reconciliation problem occurred because students would manually drop their
CCCOnline class at the home college and the information did not get
uploaded into the vendor’s database, or the software designed to update the
vendor database failed. Reconciliation took several weeks.<br>
             &emsp; All of the issues served to drive home the need for more and better ways
of communicating with our college partners and soliciting feedback.</p>

            <h2>COMMITTEES FORMED TO DEAL WITH<br>
ONGOING ISSUES
</h2>
</center>
                    <p>   &emsp; As CCCOnline evolved and grew, three major teams or committees were
formed. They are the Community College Coordinators (CCC), the Ready
Response Team (RRT), and the Online Curriculum Committee (OCC). Each
of these committees or teams plays a vital role in the success and future growth
of CCCOnline.</p>
            <h3>Community College Coordinators</h3>
            <p>  &emsp; The Community College Coordinators (CCC) was the first committee</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragraph">
            
            <p>created. The presidents of each of the member colleges designated a person
to represent them on this committee. Representation includes instructional
and student services administrators, registrars, business officers, instructors,
and campus distance education staff. The CCC meets quarterly. They discuss
the current status of the program and receive information about how the
program is changing or evolving (including new policies and procedures).
When the CCC was first formed, its major role was to identify and discuss
issues that the colleges uncovered in the ongoing maintenance and implementation of CCCOnline. These frank discussions surfaced problems identified
by one college but actually impacting many colleges. These issues were then
sent to the Educational Services Council for resolution.<br>
              &emsp; The Educational Services Council is comprised of all the member
college vice-presidents for student services, vice-presidents for instruction, and some CC of C support staff. Approximately 40 people from
around the state attend the monthly Educational Services Council meetings. The size of the Council quickly became a deterrent to quick resolution of issues. The Council determined that a smaller team was
needed to investigate issues and make recommendations to the full group.
                As a result, the Ready Response Team was created.</p>
            <h3>Ready Response Team</h3>
            <p>   &emsp; Initial membership of the Ready Response Team (RRT) was comprised of ten Educational Service Council members (including vicepresidents of student services and vice-presidents of instruction). Over
time, some of the vice-presidents sent representatives in their place. Some
of these representatives became members of the team, providing different
perspectives and useful suggestions. From its inception, the RRT met
monthly to discuss and study current issues, and recommend new policies
and procedures to deal with these issues. As the issues submitted to the
team broadened, the RRT expanded its membership to include business
services staff and college distance education directors. At present, there
are 14 people on this committee, representing eight urban and rural
                member colleges and CC of C office.<br>
               &emsp; Participation in the RRT is high and issues or concerns brought to the
RRT are discussed in great detail. Timeliness is key, however, and the goal
is to create a policy/procedure recommendation within two months after
reviewing an issue. Some issues, such as the online grading policy, may take
longer than two months to resolve. However, every issue brought before the
RRT has resulted in policy or procedure recommendation within five months.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>  &emsp; If the RRT determines it doesn’t have enough information or subject
matter expertise to deal with an issue, the issue is submitted to another CC of
C committee for resolution. For example, the RRT requested that the college
registrars create draft forms for the approval of the Educational Services
Council when it was determined that common grade change and incomplete
forms would improve efficiency. When enrollment reconciliation continued
to pose problems and delays, the RRT asked the college Business Officers and
the CC of C's centralized Computer Department to meet and create a better
process. When concerns were expressed about how new degrees would be
developed, the RRT created a flow chart of what activities should occur, what
college committees needed to be involved/informed, and the order in which
activities needed to take place. When CCCOnline faculty requested a common grading policy, the RRT developed a proposal, sent it to the registrars for
comment, and then returned the completed proposal to the Educational
Services Council for approval.<br>
              &emsp; The RRT was also responsible for the creation of the third major
committee, the Online Curriculum Committee (OCC). The RRT spent many
months discussing how to enhance communications to faculty groups at the
colleges and improve faculty buy-in. The OCC seemed to be the most
aggressive way to deal with the faculty concerns about the academic integrity
of the curriculum. It was also a response to faculty complaints about lack of
inclusion in the course and degree development process.</p>
            <h3>Online Curriculum Committee</h3>
            <p>  &emsp; The OCC approves the online program curriculum once Educational
Services has approved development of a degree or certificate. This committee
has a representative from every college in the consortium. The committee also
has one registrar. Once curriculum is approved by the OCC, it can be
developed on the CCCOnline site. The OCC does not have authority to
approve curriculum that will be used in the traditional classroom. However,
any individual college that wishes to use the approved online curriculum in
the traditional classroom may do so.</p>

            <h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2></center>
            <p>  &emsp; I can often be heard saying, “you can’t mandate what matters.” CCCOnline
was created by the combined visions of very small group of people. If the
people you need to be successful don’t “buy-in” to your vision, then it will be
difficult, if not impossible to implement. The argument that “everyone else is
doing it” is not likely to make an impression on most of your constituents. As</p>
            
        </div>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I worked with the many different constituents and groups in the CC of C, I
realized that, in times of plenty or scarcity, each constituent has very different
motivators for doing something above and beyond the norm.<br>
              &emsp; The constituents are also loyal to their individual college missions. A
program that removes local management and control of any facet of providing
education or services to students will be met with dislike, distaste, and
distrust. The following practices would serve a management team well:</p>
        <ol>    
            <li>The team must be continually attentive and take the time to get to know
the constituents, seek out their hidden motivators and make efforts to
                integrate these motivators into the program development.</li>
 <li>The team has to be dependable and follow through on any commitments
to research topics and vendors, develop courses, and provide information requested by constituents.
    <li> The team must provide requested services in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>The team must continually move the program forward and simultaneously respect the fact that different constituents will adapt to change
            at different rates.</li>
<li>The team must live service leadership and be genuine when it states, “We
    are here to serve you and your colleges. Together, we all win.”</li>
            </ol>
            <center>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            </center>
            <p>  &emsp; A consortium of the size and scope of CCCOnline continues to face
new issues on an almost daily basis. Communications are many and yet
never seem to be enough. Sometimes well-intentioned procedures and
processes are approved and implemented, and then revised within a few
weeks after implementation because new data is received making changes
imperative. Additionally, as the state commission on higher education
changes its policies, CCCOnline is required to change its policies or
procedures to be in compliance.<br>
              &emsp; There is little literature available for personnel involved in the management of an online consortium of the size and scope of CCCOnline. The
consortial clients for CCCOnline are colleges that are endeavoring to respond
to their individual communities by providing learning and training options for
personal and workforce development. Service to local communities is a
primary mission. Growth of the consortium will be stymied if the consortium
cannot show how serving a more global community will enhance services to
the local community. Interacting with members of other colleges will allow
the various staff and faculty to get a wider perspective on issues. They get to
see beyond their college’s back-door.</p>
